# Flashcards


##  Using constructors to hide and reveal answers on "flashcards" 

Using:
* JavaScript
* Node.js


This is a backend program for a basic flashcard application.

The program does require that the inquirer API be installed on the user machine.

These flashcards will make use of cloze deletion which is simply a sentence that has had some of its text removed.  The removed text is like the back of a flashcard - to reveal the correct answer.

This programming is useful for building flash card applications that forces users to remember the important part of a sentence, and is a common device in educational applications.
